# Yurtcraft

#### A Minecraft-themed game designed for Brown Unviersity's new VR environment (YURT).
##### Created by Evan Birenbaum '15 and Andrew DiMarco '15

Built into a Minecraft clone created from scratch for previous coursework, this game leverages the VRG3D framework to run, display, and respond to user input in supported virtual reality environments. It was created for the grand opening of Brown University's new virual environment, the YURT Ultimate Reality Theater.

The basic idea for the game was simple - create a game where people physically move their bodies to dodge incoming projectiles and shoot their own. Since there was only a week for implementation, the Minecraft theme was used as a way of providing a reasonably interesting environment, and work was focused on the core gameplay logic.

The VrFrontend and dependent classes also implement a simpler and easier to use interface for VRG3D's event mechanics, making it possible to create an application with VRG3D without ever having to reference it's classes.

We apologize for the quality of the codebase - working with the YURT was difficult, and given the limited time period in which to develop and test the application, we opted to focus on code functionality rather than quality.
